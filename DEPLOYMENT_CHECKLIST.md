# üöÄ Pre-Deployment Checklist

## ‚úÖ Required Steps Before Deploying to Netlify

### 1. Supabase Setup

- [ ] **Run RLS Policies SQL** (from previous conversation)
  - File: `clean-rls-policies.sql`
  - This fixes contact form and blog creation permissions
  
- [ ] **Run Storage Setup SQL** ‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL - NOT DONE YET**
  - File: `supabase/storage-setup.sql`
  - Creates `blog-images` bucket for image uploads
  - Without this, image upload will fail with "Bucket not found"

- [ ] **Verify in Supabase Dashboard:**
  - Go to **Storage** ‚Üí Should see `blog-images` bucket
  - Go to **Authentication** ‚Üí **Policies** ‚Üí Should see 6 RLS policies (one per table)
  - Go to **Storage** ‚Üí **Policies** ‚Üí Should see 4 policies for blog-images

### 2. Environment Variables

Check your `.env` file has all required variables:

```bash
# Supabase
SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key

# Admin
ADMIN_PASSWORD=your_admin_password
```

### 3. Test Locally First

Before deploying, test everything works:

```bash
# Start dev server
npm run dev
```

**Test these features:**
- [ ] Homepage loads
- [ ] Projects page loads (fixed the .map error)
- [ ] Experience page loads
- [ ] Blogs page loads
- [ ] Individual blog pages load
- [ ] Contact form submits successfully
- [ ] Admin login works
- [ ] Admin can create blog
- [ ] Admin can upload image (after running storage SQL)

### 4. Build Check

Make sure the project builds without errors:

```bash
npm run build
```

If build succeeds, you're ready to deploy!

### 5. Netlify Deployment

#### Option A: Deploy via Netlify CLI

```bash
# Install Netlify CLI (if not installed)
npm install -g netlify-cli

# Login to Netlify
netlify login

# Deploy
netlify deploy --prod
```

#### Option B: Deploy via GitHub

1. Push your code to GitHub
2. Go to Netlify Dashboard
3. Click "Add new site" ‚Üí "Import an existing project"
4. Connect to GitHub repository
5. Configure build settings:
   - **Build command:** `npm run build`
   - **Publish directory:** `.output/public`
   - **Functions directory:** `.netlify/functions` (auto-detected for Nuxt)

#### Set Environment Variables in Netlify

Go to **Site settings ‚Üí Environment variables** and add:

```
SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
ADMIN_PASSWORD=your_admin_password
```

### 6. Post-Deployment Tests

After deployment, test on the live site:

- [ ] Visit your Netlify URL
- [ ] Test contact form
- [ ] Test blog pages
- [ ] Test admin login
- [ ] Test image upload (should work if storage SQL was run)

## üêõ Common Issues

### Issue: "Bucket not found" on image upload
**Solution:** Run `supabase/storage-setup.sql` in Supabase SQL Editor

### Issue: Contact form returns 500 error
**Solution:** Run the RLS policies SQL (clean-rls-policies.sql)

### Issue: Build fails
**Solution:** 
- Check for TypeScript errors: `npm run typecheck`
- Check for missing dependencies: `npm install`
- Check error logs in terminal

### Issue: Admin login doesn't work on production
**Solution:** Make sure `ADMIN_PASSWORD` environment variable is set in Netlify

### Issue: Blogs don't load
**Solution:** 
- Check Supabase RLS policies are enabled
- Verify `blogs` table exists
- Check browser console for errors
